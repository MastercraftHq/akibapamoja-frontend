### Notes

- Keep files modular and meaningful — each feature (like authentication or savings) should live in its own folder under `features/`.
- Use `services/` for external requests like REST APIs or Supabase functions.
- Stick to consistent naming conventions (e.g., camelCase).
- Avoid storing logic in `App.jsx` — keep it lean and delegate to `routes/`.
